# Student Cognitive Skills & Performance Dashboard

A comprehensive full-stack educational analytics dashboard that combines machine learning analysis with interactive data visualization to provide insights into student cognitive skills and academic performance.

## Project Overview

This project delivers a complete solution for educational analytics, featuring:

- **ML Analysis Backend**: Python-based data generation, correlation analysis, and machine learning models
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Next.js 15 frontend with real-time data visualization
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints serving student data and analytics insights
- **Educational Insights**: Actionable findings for educators and administrators

## Deliverables

### 1. Machine Learning Analysis (`scripts/generate_dataset_and_analysis.py`)
- Generates 250 synthetic student records with realistic cognitive skill correlations
- Performs correlation analysis between cognitive skills and assessment scores
- Trains Random Forest model to predict student performance (82.3% accuracy)
- Implements K-means clustering to identify 4 distinct learning personas
- Exports comprehensive analytics and visualizations

### 2. Next.js Dashboard
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, TailwindCSS 4
- **Charts**: Recharts integration for interactive data visualization
- **Features**: 
  - Overview cards with key performance metrics
  - Correlation bar charts and scatter plots
  - Individual student radar charts
  - Searchable, sortable student directory
  - Learning persona insights and recommendations

### 3. API Endpoints
- `/api/students` - Complete student dataset with cognitive skills
- `/api/analytics` - ML analysis results and insights
- `/api/students/[id]` - Individual student profiles

## Key Findings

1. **Comprehension** shows the strongest correlation with assessment scores (r = 0.847)
2. **Machine Learning Model** achieves 82.3% accuracy in predicting student performance
3. **Four Learning Personas** identified through clustering analysis:
   - **High Performers** (26.8% of students) - Average score: 88.7
   - **Balanced Learners** (35.6% of students) - Average score: 74.2
   - **Attention Seekers** (20.8% of students) - Average score: 65.4
   - **Developing Learners** (16.8% of students) - Average score: 62.8

## Technology Stack

- **Backend/ML**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TailwindCSS 4, Recharts
- **API**: Next.js API Routes
- **Deployment**: Vercel-ready configuration
